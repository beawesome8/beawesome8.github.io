      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Data Scientist driven by a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights and captivating visualizations using advanced Business Intelligence tools. 
        My curiosity in the evolving landscape of Generative AI fuels my enthusiasm for automating routine workflows, enhancing efficiency, and facilitating informed decision-making.
        Confident in my abilities to build machine learning pipelines and simulation models that enhance operational efficiency while driving informed decision making. 
        <br>
        My professional journey began as a Business Analyst at a dynamic start-up, 
        where I developed a keen aptitude for data analytics—a passion. 
        Prior to joining the startup i was lucky to have worked as an intern data scientist. This internship developed my fundamnetals of data science and machine learning, 
        that I am further honing curerntly through my Master's studies in Business Intelligence and Data Science at ISM Munich. Along with my studies i haved been working part-time
        at infineon analysing and managing PPAP and contract data. This has been an enriching experience that has further strengthened my analytical skills and has prepared me for the challenges of the industry.
        <br>
        Recently i have devloped a keen interest in Generative AI and have been exploring its potential in various domains. I wish to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the 
        development of innovative solutions that drive positive change. Alongside i wish to learn and explore new technologies and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

          <h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          This project is aimed at building a prototype of a customer segmentation model. 
          The customers will be segmented into clusters, 
          using K-means clustering, based on similar characteristics, behaviours and needs. 
          The model is validated using the inertia and silhouette score. 
          This model can be used to launch segment specific campaign and tailor features accordingly. 
          They can even target a specific sector based on their behaviours.
